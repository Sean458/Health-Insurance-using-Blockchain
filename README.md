# Health-Insurance-using-Blockchain

<h3>Overview</h3>
The healthcare industry is an inseparable part
of people’s lives and contributes directly to their well-being.
However, it is often seen that a rise in the costs of healthcare
services leads to financial instability. In times of economic
hardships, health insurance plays a vital role in providing
financial support to patients. One of the functions of these
health insurance providers is to monitor and maintain
patients’ health records while upholding their privacy.
However, in most cases, claim processing is a multistage
process. Delays caused by these multiple stages can affect the
quality of treatment in patients. 
<br></br>
The need of the hour for claim
processing systems is speed while maintaining integrity. We
propose a blockchain-based solution to store health insurance
records digitally on decentralized storage that is secure and
free from tampering while being efficient. The claim processing
system can then be included as a part of a smart contract that
accesses these health insurance records. These smart contracts
automate the process of claim approval removing any
intervention from third parties or preventing any breach of
pre-committed agreements.
